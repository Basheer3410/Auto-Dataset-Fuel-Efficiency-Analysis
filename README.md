# Auto-Dataset-Fuel-Efficiency-Analysis
This project involves performing **exploratory data analysis on the Auto dataset** after removing missing values. The task includes identifying **quantitative and qualitative predictors**, calculating the **range, mean, and standard deviation** of quantitative variables, and re-evaluating these statistics after removing observations from the **10th to 85th rows**. The analysis also uses **graphical methods such as scatterplots** to study relationships among predictors and assess whether any variables appear useful in **predicting gas mileage (mpg)** based on observed trends and patterns.
